Most IT organizations validate projects using a small set of recurring “gates” and business rules around strategy, value, feasibility, risk, and compliance.[1][2]

## Typical validation moments

Most IT project portfolios validate projects at these points:  
- Initial idea / intake  
- Business case / feasibility  
- Detailed planning  
- Go / no‑go for build  
- Go / no‑go for release and closure[3][4][1]

At each gate, the project must satisfy predefined criteria (business rules) to proceed, be reworked, or be stopped.[5][6][1]

## Core business rules at intake

At the earliest stage, rules are usually about “should we even look at this?”:  
- Strategic alignment: project must clearly support at least one strategic objective or portfolio theme.[7][1]
- Problem/need clarity: business problem, target users, and high‑level outcomes must be described and agreed.[2][8]
- Rough feasibility: there must be a plausible technical approach and no obvious blockers (technology, data, legal).[1][2]

## Business case and feasibility rules

Before full approval, organizations typically enforce rules like:  
- Defined scope and success criteria: documented requirements, scope statement, and acceptance criteria or KPIs.[9][10][11]
- Cost, schedule, and ROI: realistic estimates for budget and timeline, plus value/benefits or ROI that meet minimum thresholds.[12][2][1]
- Risk assessment: identified key risks (technical, security, operational, vendor, change management) with mitigation plans.[12][1]

## Execution and release rules

While running the project, gates often check control, quality, and readiness:  
- Governance and tracking: progress within approved tolerances for scope, schedule, and budget; updated risk and issue logs.[4][1]
- Quality and user validation: passed integration/UAT tests and stakeholder acceptance against defined criteria.[10][9]
- Compliance, security, and legal: required architecture, security, privacy, and legal reviews completed and approved before release.[8][5][12]

## After‑deployment rules

Finally, validation focuses on value and closure:  
- Benefits realization: initial check that key outcomes/benefits are being achieved or are on track.[2][1]
- Operational handover: support, monitoring, documentation, and ownership in production are confirmed.[4][1]
- Closure artifacts: lessons learned and final approvals completed so the project can be formally closed and archived.[1][4]

## Example rule categories table

| Category        | Typical business rules (IT projects) |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Strategy        | Aligns to at least one strategic objective; not duplicating existing initiatives. [1][7] |
| Scope & requirements | Problem, scope, and acceptance criteria documented and approved; change control defined. [9][10][8] |
| Value & ROI    | Positive business case; meets minimum ROI or benefit threshold vs. cost and risk. [1][2][7] |
| Feasibility    | Viable architecture, technology stack, and resource plan; key dependencies identified. [1][12] |
| Risk & compliance | Major risks logged with mitigations; security, privacy, and legal constraints addressed. [1][5][12][8] |
| Delivery control | Plan with milestones; tracked variances for scope, time, and cost; escalation rules defined. [1][4] |
| Quality & readiness | Testing and UAT passed; stakeholders sign off; support and monitoring ready for go‑live. [1][9][10] |

If you share more about the specific type of IT project (internal business app, external SaaS, infra change, etc.), a more concrete checklist of rules can be drafted.

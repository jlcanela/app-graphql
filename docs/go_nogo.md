GO / NO GO for build is the gate where the organization decides whether the project is ready to start development (execution) given scope, value, risk, and readiness.[1][2]

Below is a structured set of business‑rule categories commonly used at that gate for IT projects; each rule is typically expressed as “must be true” (GO) or triggers a NO‑GO / rework.

## Strategy and scope

- The project still aligns with current business and IT strategy, and remains a priority versus other initiatives.[3][4]
- Business problem, target users, scope, and success metrics are documented, baselined, and approved (no major open questions).[5][6][2]
- Out‑of‑scope items and interfaces to other projects/systems are identified and accepted by stakeholders.[2][5]

## Business case and financials

- Updated cost, benefit, and ROI are calculated with recent estimates, and still meet portfolio thresholds.[4][3]
- Funding is secured for at least the upcoming build phase (preferably for the full project), including contingency.[7][8]
- Major underlying business assumptions (volumes, adoption, savings, revenue) have been validated to a reasonable level (e.g., via discovery or pilots).[3][4]

## Technical feasibility and architecture

- Target solution architecture is reviewed and approved (patterns, integration, data flows, hosting, cloud/on‑prem, etc.).[9][2]
- Chosen technologies, platforms, and tools are available, supported internally, and compatible with enterprise standards.[9][2]
- Key technical risks or unknowns (e.g., performance, legacy integration, vendor APIs) have mitigation spikes or PoC results, or are explicitly accepted with contingency.[4][9]

## Delivery plan and resources

- A realistic delivery plan exists with milestones, dependencies, and critical path identified for the build phase.[5][2]
- Core roles (product owner, tech lead/architect, developers, QA, UX, ops/DevOps) are staffed with named people and confirmed capacity.[10][9]
- External suppliers or partners (if any) have signed contracts or SoWs aligned with scope, timelines, and SLAs.[11][3]

## Requirements, quality, and acceptance

- Functional and non‑functional requirements for the build phase are specified to a level that allows development to start (e.g., prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria).[6][9]
- Definition of Done, acceptance criteria, and test strategy (unit, integration, performance, security, UAT) are documented and agreed.[6][10]
- Quality standards (coding standards, code review rules, coverage thresholds, performance targets, reliability/availability SLOs) are defined.[10][6]

## Risk, compliance, and security

- A consolidated risk register exists, with high and critical risks assigned owners and mitigation actions; overall risk level is within the organization’s tolerance.[3][4]
- Security, privacy, and regulatory requirements are identified; where required, security/architecture/compliance reviews are passed or have approved action plans.[2][3]
- Business continuity and data protection impacts (backups, DR, RPO/RTO, data residency) are assessed and accepted.[2][10]

## Organization, change, and stakeholders

- Key stakeholders (business owner, sponsor, IT owner, affected departments) explicitly approve moving to build (e.g., signed gate form or steering decision).[1][5]
- Change‑management needs are assessed: impact on roles/processes, training needs, communications plan, and support model are at least sketched and budgeted.[11][5]
- No major unresolved conflicts between stakeholder expectations (e.g., scope vs. budget vs. timeline) remain; if trade‑offs exist, they are documented and approved.[1][3]

## Go / No‑Go rule patterns

- GO: All mandatory criteria are satisfied; minor issues only with accepted risk and agreed follow‑up actions.[11][1]
- CONDITIONAL GO: One or more criteria are partially met but can be resolved quickly; a dated action plan and owners are required.[1][11]
- NO‑GO: One or more “hard stop” criteria fail (e.g., funding not secured, critical architecture/security concerns, missing key roles, unacceptable risk). Project is paused, re‑scoped, or cancelled.[4][1]

### Example decision‑rule table

| Category           | Example GO / NO‑GO rules at build gate |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Strategy & scope   | GO if project still aligns with at least one current strategic objective and approved scope; NO‑GO if objective is obsolete or scope fundamentally disputed. [3][4] |
| Business case      | GO if updated NPV/ROI beats portfolio minimum and funding is secured; NO‑GO if value case is negative or budget not approved. [3][4] |
| Technical          | GO if architecture approved and tech stack feasible; NO‑GO if critical technical blockers or rejected architecture review. [9][2] |
| Plan & resources   | GO if realistic schedule and key roles staffed; NO‑GO if team capacity or key skills are missing for the planned window. [9][5] |
| Quality & requirements | GO if requirements/backlog and acceptance criteria are ready; NO‑GO if requirements are too vague to plan sprints or builds. [9][6] |
| Risk & compliance  | GO if high risks are mitigated/accepted and compliance/security sign‑offs in place; NO‑GO if unacceptable unmitigated risks remain. [3][2] |
| Stakeholders & change | GO if sponsor and key stakeholders approve and change impact is owned; NO‑GO if sponsor support is withdrawn or major impacted area refuses. [1][5] |

If you describe your environment (scale, regulated vs. not, internal vs. external product), a tailored checklist of concrete, testable rules can be drafted for your context.
